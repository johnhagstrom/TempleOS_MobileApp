**Installation**

**Note**

I'm looking to pass the torch with this app to someone who is more well-versed in mobile application development than myself. Please don't hesitiate to clone/download and help improve the app!

**TODO:**
- Notifications (local and push)
- Livestream fullscreen option, volume controls, pause
- Resume stream after backing out and going back in
- Resume chat after backing out and going back in
